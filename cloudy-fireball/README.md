This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


### Collaborators should start with the main branch by using:
```
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Once the commands above have been run, create a new branch per feature you're working on using:
```
git checkout -b "new-feature"
```

### Update add, and commit as you normally would with git. To allow other collaborators to view your updates, use:
```
git push -u origin "new-feature"
```

### Forgot to create a new branch? Use:
```
git checkout "current_branch"
git branch "new-branch"
git switch "new-branch"
```

### Want the latest main while still working on a branch? Use:
```
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

git checkout "feature"
git merge main
```
